				<h2>Geographical Coverage</h2>
				<p>IMA BBC & RC is situated at Thrissur, the geographical center of Kerala. The immediate beneficiaries of this facility will be the people of three districts i.e.Thrissur, Palakkad, and Malappuram;  The approximate area of  which will be about 100 square kilometers and the total population over  seven million people.<br>

Even though the processing cost of the blood is intended to be charged from the user, a great part of the population are given subsidy or even free services. This section is estimated to comprise about 60% of the population; i.e. over four million people. In addition to this, since the facilities available at this center hardly exist anywhere else in Kerala, the whole population of the state will be long-term beneficiaries.
